# ConsoleLoopover
Remake of Carkh's loopover for console in C# .NET Core

Application saves statistics inside a json file<br>
On widows: `%appdata%\Loopover\save.json`<br>
On linux should be: `home/.config/Loopover/save.json`

Times made while trying scramble aren't saved

## Color scheme
Recommended color scheme for Windows Terminal:
```
{
    "background": "#0C0C0C",
    "black": "#0C0C0C",
    "blue": "#0037DA",
    "brightBlack": "#767676",
    "brightBlue": "#3B78FF",
    "brightCyan": "#2A7081",
    "brightGreen": "#3DD435",
    "brightPurple": "#B4009E",
    "brightRed": "#E4771E",
    "brightWhite": "#F2F2F2",
    "brightYellow": "#F9F1A5",
    "cursorColor": "#FFFFFF",
    "cyan": "#49C7C7",
    "foreground": "#CCCCCC",
    "green": "#13A10E",
    "name": "Loopover",
    "purple": "#881798",
    "red": "#C50F1F",
    "selectionBackground": "#FFFFFF",
    "white": "#CCCCCC",
    "yellow": "#E7BA04"
},
```
The defult colors should be usable as well.<br>
I used `Consolas` font in my terminal, but any monospace font where character size ratio is `width : height = 1 : 2` should be fine.
